                    <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
                    <p>Thailand is a year-round destination due to its tropical climate. The best time to visit would be during the cool and dry season (between November and early April). This season is more comfortable, as it has less humidity and lower temperatures making it ideal for outdoor activities.(Hunt, 2019)</p>
